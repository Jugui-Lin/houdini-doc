""" The Marmoset Export ROP allows you to quickly generate an mview inside Houdini """

The Marmoset Export ROP allows you to quickly export either an mview or render using Marmoset straight from inside Houdini. Additionally, you can also use this tool as a bridge to open geometry in Marmoset with material assigned.

@parameters
    Render:
        This renders either an image to disk.
    Export:
        This will render from Marmoset using the selected method.
    == Mview Render ==
    Output:
        This specifies where the generated mview should be saved.
    
    == Image ==
    Resolution:
        Specify the desired resolution for the generated render.
    Sampling:
        Allows you to set the number of samples per pixel.
    Transparent Background:
        When this is enabled, your render will have a transparent background rather than the background image.
    Output:
        This is the location where the render will be saved.

    == Rendering ==
    Camera:
        Specifies which camera should be used for rendering.
    Candidate Objects:
        Objects will not be output if their display flag is off.
    Skylight:
        Selects which method should be used to assign the skylight properties. Preset will use detected .tbsky files found in the directory specified by the `Marmoset Library` parameter.
    Name:
        Allows for selecting which locally found .tbsky file to use.
    Image:
        Sets the image to be assigned to the skylight.
    == Settings ==
    Marmoset Executable:
        This needs to be set to the location of where you have marmoset "toolbag.exe" installed.
    Marmoset Library:
        This is the directory Marmoset uses to set %MSETLIBRARY%. 
    Material Mapping:
        This is the material mapping file to use internally in the tool. This allows for using custom material definitions with Labs tools.
