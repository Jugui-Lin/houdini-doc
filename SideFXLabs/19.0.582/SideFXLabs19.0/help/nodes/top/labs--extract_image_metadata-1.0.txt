""" Extract image metadata using iinfo. """

This node will extract image metadata from input images that have a file/image tag attached to them, and store them as attributes. This is useful for filtering workitems based on various image metadata.

NOTE:
    This node calls the utility tool called `iinfo` which ships with Houdini. It does so with subprocess in python.
