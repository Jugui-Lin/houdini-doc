""" Generates `material_override` attributes per primitive based on the assigned material.  """

TIP:
    Since material_override attributes are simply dictionaries, you can very easily modify materials on a per-primitive basis by changing the attribute.

NOTE:
    Not all tools in Houdini might understand material overrides yet. If you find issues with tools, please let SideFX Support know.

@parameters
    Group:
        The selection of primitives to generate `material_override` attributes for.
    Overrides:
        Optionally override `material_override` key-value pairs during the creation of the attribute. Simply set key values in a variable called `material`.
