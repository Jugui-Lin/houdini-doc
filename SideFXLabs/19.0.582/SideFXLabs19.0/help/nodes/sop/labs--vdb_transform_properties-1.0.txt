"""Converts the input volume/VDB field to a VDB vector field and updates how the vector field will respond to transformations downstream."""

Labs VDB Transform Properties SOP changes how a volume/VDB field will respond to transformations applied downstream. It converts the input field to a VDB vector field and updates the vector field's primitive intrinsic attribute `vdb_vector_type`.

A common use case is to convert `vel.x`, `vel.y`, and `vel.z` to a VDB contravariant relative vector field so that the velocities can respond correctly to both Transform SOPs and object transforms.


@parameters

    Source Field:
        #id: sourcefield
        The name of the volume/VDB field to update. If this is three scalar fields which are components of the same vector field, just type in the name of the vector field. For instance, for `vel.x`, `vel.y`, and `vel.z`, just type in `vel`.
        
    Vector Field Type:
        #id: vectype
        Sets how transformations will be applied to the vector field.
        <p>*Tuple/Color/UVW*: Does not transform.</p>
        <p>*Gradient/Normal*: Applies the inverse-transpose of the transform matrix, ignoring translation.</p>
        <p>*Unit Normal*: Applies the forward transform matrix, ignoring translation.</p>
        <p>*Displacement/Velocity/Acceleration*: Applies the forward transform matrix, ignoring translation.</p>
        <p>*Position*: Applies “regular” transformation, vector translates.</p>
            
    Remove Source Scalar VDBs:
        #id: removesource
        Deletes the scalar VDBs once they have been merged into a single vector field.
        
    Output Motion Vector Visualization:
        #id: motionvecvis
        Outputs motion vector visualization. You can still revert the volume back to its original look downstream by deleting the detail attribute `volvis_motionvec`.
