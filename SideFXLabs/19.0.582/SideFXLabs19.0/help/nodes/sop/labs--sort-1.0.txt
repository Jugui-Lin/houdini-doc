"""A wrapper around the default Sort SOP that adds a "Circular (Around Vector)" mode."""

This node is a wrapper around the default Sort SOP node that ships with Houdini.

@parameters

    == Points ==

    Point Group:
        #id: ptgroup
        The points to restrict the sort to. Only these points will be re-arranged by the point sorting choices.

    Point Sort:
        How to sort the elements.

        Circular (Around Vector):
            Orders the elements counterclockwise by their position around a certain line in 3D space.
            You can define that line with the Vector parameter.

    Vector:
        #id: pointdir
        When the sort method is "Along Vector" or "Circular (Around Vector)", the vector to use for sorting. This vector is signed, so a value of `0, 1, 0` is the equivalent of sorting By Y, while `0, -1, 0` is the reverse.

    Angle Offset:
        #id: pointangleoffset
        Shifts the current element numbers forward or backward based on that angle (in degrees). Point numbers at the end of the point list wrap around to the start.

    Reverse Point Sort:
        #id: pointreverse
        In case the Point Sort method is set to Circular, sorts the points clockwise around the defined vector.

    == Primitives ==

    Primitive Group:
        #id: primgroup
        The primitives to restrict the sort to.  Only these primitives will be re-arranged by the primitive sorting operation.

    Primitive Sort:
        See the help for Point sort above.

    Reverse Primitive Sort:
        #id: primreverse
        See the help for Reverse Point Sort above.
