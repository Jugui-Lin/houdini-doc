""" Network Walk is a set of four actions that allow you to step or walk around the Network View based on connectivity via keyboard hotkeys.  """

== Overview ==
Network Walk is a set of four actions that allow you to step or walk around the Network View based on connectivity via keyboard hotkeys. 


By default, these actions are mapped to the  corresponding hotkeys so that ((PageUp)) walks up, ((PageDown)) walks down, ((Insert)) walks left, and ((Home)) walks right.


Coupled with the default ((U)) and ((D)) keys, networks can be traversed quickly and intuitively.

Network Walk displays brief messages in the Network View to help orientate yourself, and orientates itself appropriately in Vop style networks for spatial continuity.

The Network Walk shelf tool either installs or uninstalls itâ€™s actions and hotkey keys. 

Install de-assigns the default keymappings, before assigning the Labs Network Walk actions.
Uninstall will remove all the Labs Network Walk actions and restore the default actions. For changes to take effect, Houdini may need a restart.
