"""Finds edge loops or quad loops from manually or procedurally selected start edges."""

Labs Loops from Selection SOP finds edge loops or quad loops from manually or procedurally selected start edges. You can easily identify a loop with a single start edge. You can also select multiple start edges or input existing edge groups to find multiple loops at once.

The node will create a group containing all the loops. It can also create an additional group for each individual loop.


@parameters

    Find:
        #id: outputmode
        What type of loops to find and output. The node will attempt to find a loop starting from each individual edge in *Start Edge Group*, so the output may contain one or multiple loops. The search on either side of a start edge will terminate independently if *Max Steps* has been reached on that side. Each loop type also has its own additional termination condition.
        <p>*Edge Loops*: Each start edge indicates the direction of an edge loop. The loop only continues when there is one and only one next edge that does not belong to a primitive that contains the current edge.</p>
        <p>*Quad Loops*: Each start edge indicates the cross-section direction of a quad loop. The loop terminates when the current primitive (or, optionally, the next primitive) is not a quad.</p>
        <p>*Terminates at Non-quads*: The ends of quad loops can be non-quads.</p>
        <p>*Terminates before Non-quads*: The ends of quad loops cannot be non-quads.</p>

    Start Edge Group:
        #id: startedgegroup
        Manually select edges from the viewport or input existing edge groups. The node will attempt to find a loop starting from each individual edge in this group, so the output may contain one or multiple loops. For an edge loop, a start edge indicates the direction of a loop. For a quad loop, a start edge indicates the cross-section direction of a loop.
        
    Max Steps:
        #id: maxsteps
        The search on either side of a start edge will terminate independently if this step limit has been reached on that side.

    Output Edge Group:
        #id: outputedgegroup
        Name of the edge group containing all the edge loops.
        
    Output Quad Group:
        #id: outputprimgroup
        Name of the primitives group containing all the quad loops.

    Create Additional Group Per Loop:
        #id: groupperloop
        Creates an additional group for each individual loop. Unlike the default group that contains all the loops, the additional single-loop groups have names ending with indices.

    Visualize Single Group:
        #id: vissingleloop
        Highlights a single loop. Only applicable when *Create Group Per Loop* is on.

    Single Loop Index:
        #id: singleloopidx
        Which loop to highlight when *Create Group Per Loop* and *Visualize Single Loop* are both on.
