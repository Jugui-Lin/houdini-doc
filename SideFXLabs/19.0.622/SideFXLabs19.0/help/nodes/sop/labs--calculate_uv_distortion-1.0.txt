""" Calculate UV distortion of a piece of geometry """

This node will allow you to calculate UV distortion for the specified UV attribute and export it as a primitive attribute.
The node will visualize the distortion by default using a visualizer, but this can be disabled.

NOTE:
    The attribute values the tool generates are generally centered around 0, meaning no distortion. Values higher than 0 indicate a primitive is being compressed, while negative values indicate that significant stretching is happening.


@parameters
    Group:
        The group to calculate the uv distortio for. 
    UV Attribute:
        The attribute to be used for calculating uv distortion. 
    Output Attribute:
        The primitive attribute to be created storing the distortion amount.
    Visualize:
        Toggle for enabling or disabling the creation of a visualizer for the distortion.
