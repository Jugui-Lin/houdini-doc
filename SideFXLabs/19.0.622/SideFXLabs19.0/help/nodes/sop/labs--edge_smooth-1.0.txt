This tool will smooth the specified input edge groups and relax the surrounding points. It can often be used together with Cluster SOP or Labs Random Selection SOP to create stylized models or FX patterns.

@parameters
    Group:
	Edge-groups or a selection of edges to be smoothed.
    Include Unshared Edges:
	Automatically detect and smooth unshared edges.
    == Edge Smoothing ==
    Strength:
	The amount of smoothing to be applied to the edges.
    Filter Quality:
        Higher values preserve finer details from the original mesh. Lower values are faster and smooth more.
    == Neighbor Smoothing ==
    Neighbor Range:
        The number of steps to be made from the original edge group when deciding which neighbors should be smoothed.
    Steps:
        The amount of smoothing steps to be applied to the neighbors.
