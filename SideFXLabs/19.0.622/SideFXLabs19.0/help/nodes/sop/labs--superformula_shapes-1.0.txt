""" This tool creates 2D shapes using the superformula equation. """


== Overview ==

This node creates 2-D shapes using Johan Gielis's superformula equation. Shapes can be rendered as open or filled polygons and convenience options are provided for resampling and triangulating. UV's are automatically calculated.

=== Predefined Shapes ===

SuperShapes provides presets for the following shapes:

:fig: [Image:/images/superformula_shapes_array.svg]
    #display: full left
    
    """Predefined shapes: square, circle, equilateral triangle, isosceles triangle, right triangle, n-sided polygon, diamond, star, squircle, rounded triangle, clover, flower, sunburst, eye, teardrop."""


@parameters

    == Shape Settings ==

	Shape Selection:
		#id: shapeselect
		Select from one of the predefined shapes or choose __Custom__ to experiment with the superformula equation.


	
	Shape Options:
		
		__Number of Spokes__ determines the number of spokes on shapes with spoked geometry. For instance: the number of points on a star, leaves on a clover, petals on a flower, etc. 
		
		__Spoke Look__ modifies the look of spokes for clover and flower shapes. 
	
		__Pinch/Bloat__ will squeeze the non-spoke portion of spoked geometry toward the center (pinch) or push it toward the spokes (bloat).
		
        
    === Custom Parameters ===
	In addition to predefined shapes, the __Custom__ option offers direct access to the parameters of the superformula equation for experimentation. The [Wikipedia article|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superformula/] on the superformula is a good place to start when experimenting.

    Number of Points:
        #id: custompointnum
	Number of points around shape circumference.
        
    a:
        #id: customa
	Adjusts the ratio of the cosine spokes.
		
        
    b:
        #id: customb
	Adjusts the ratio of the sine spokes.
        
    m:
        #id: customm
	Adjusts the number of spokes.
        
    n1:
        #id: customn1
	Transforms the spokes in a pinch/bloat effect.
        
    n2:
        #id: customn2
	Transforms the cosine spokes.
        
    n3:
        #id: customn3
	Transforms the sine spokes.
        
    == Shape Basics ==

    Width:
        #id: width
	Scale the shape horizontally.
        
    Height:
        #id: height
	Scale the shape vertically.
        
    Fill Shape:
        #id: fillshape
	Render the shape as a filled or unfilled polygon.
        
    == Rounded Corners ==

    Rounded Corners:
        #id: roundcorners
	Rounds the corners of sharp-edged shapes via a bevel operation on the 2D geometry. See [PolyBevel|Node:sop/polybevel] for more information.
        
    == Resample ==

    Resample:
        #id: resample
	Resamples one or more curves or surfaces into even length segments. See [Resample|Node:sop/resample] for more information.
            
    == Triangulate ==

    Triangulate:
        #id: triangulate
	Convert the shape to triangular geometry via a remesh operation. See [Remesh|Node:sop/remesh] for more information.
