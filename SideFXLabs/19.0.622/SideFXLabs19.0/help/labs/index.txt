=== Shelf Updater ===
The updater provides several options for installation depending on your needs / limitations.

# Every installation of Houdini comes with a version of the SideFX Labs toolset tied to the version of Houdini. Example: Houdini 18.0.345 includes version (18.0.)345 of the toolset. Perfect for users who don't have the ability to download external packages.
# Download the latest production build. A production build is released approximately every four weeks. Similar to production builds of Houdini, the toolset is generally more stable but won't include the latest additions to the toolset.
# Download the latest development build. A daily build is released every day. These builds will contain the latest additions to the toolset including new tools, updates and bug fixes. Untick the "Production Builds Only" checkbox in the updater to see a full list of the builds available.

=== Source ===

You can also download the source and release files directly from [GitHub| https://www.github.com/sideeffects/SideFXLabs]. Convenient tags have been set up to indicate which commits have been included in what builds of Labs.

=== Changelog ===

Changelogs get posted on the forum roughly bi-weekly to keep you informed on bugfixes, new tools and general updates. You can subscribe to it [here|https://www.sidefx.com/forum/topic/70854/] to receive an email when it goes live.
